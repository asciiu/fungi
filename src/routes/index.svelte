    While everyone continues to cope with the uncertainty of COVID-19, Apollo
    Ink is fully committed to supporting essential businesses and providing
    essential products to everyone in need throughout the course of this
    pandemic. Apollo Ink puts safety first, and everyones health and well-being
    is our top priority. We are operational but have transitioned to “no
    contact” client interactions and are now online order fulfillment only.
    Until further notice our print facility and showroom will remain closed to
    the public. Our workforce has been reduced to the absolute minimum to
    maintain a clean and healthy environment. We are abiding by mandated
    protocols and additional precautionary measures to ensure the proper
    practice of social distancing. As difficult as it is for everyone to adapt
    to this fluid situation, Apollo Ink wants our clients to know that we are
    here for you. We will be doing everything in our power to help everyone move
    forward and get through these challenging circumstances.
